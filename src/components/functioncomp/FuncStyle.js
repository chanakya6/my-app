                    AngularJS is a discontinued free and open-source JavaScript-
                    based web framework for developing single-page applications.
                    It was maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals
                    and corporations. It aimed to simplify both the development and 
                    the testing of such applications by providing a framework for 
                    client-side model-view-controller MVC and model-view-viewmodel MVVM
                    architectures, along with components commonly used in web 
                    applications and progressive web applications.An open-source 
                    application framework, <a href="https://angular.io/ tar" target="_blank">AngularJs</a> is used to create interactive components of a website.

                    JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is 
                    one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
                    As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage 
                    behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers 
                    have a dedicated <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that 
                    conforms to the ECMAScript standard

                Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this 
                library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not 
                provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. 
                Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each 
                element by mixing and matching.For example, in other traditional systems, 
                there would be a class message-warning that would apply a yellow background 
                color and bold text. To achieve this result in <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a>, one would have to 
                apply a set of classes created by the library: bg-yellow-200 and font-bold.

                    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
                    <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">ReactJs</a> can be used to create single-page software applications for web and 
                    mobile platforms. The open-source library is maintained by Meta  and a community 
                    of software engineers. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is
                     widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now 
                     one of the most commonly used front-end libraries for web development.
