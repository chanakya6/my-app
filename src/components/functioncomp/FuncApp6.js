              React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
              <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React-Js</a> can 
              be used to create single-page software applications for web and mobile platforms.
              Although React is a library rather than a language, it is
              widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now 
              one of the most commonly used front-end libraries for web development.
