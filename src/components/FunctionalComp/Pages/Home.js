          <h1>Thumbbad(2018)</h1><br/>
        <p><b>Tumbbad</b> is a 2018 Hindi-language[4] horror film directed by<b>Rahi Anil Barve.</b> [1] Additionally, <b>Anand</b> Gandhi served as the creative director,[5] 
          and <b>Adesh Prasad</b> served as the co-director.[5] Written by <b>Mitesh Shah, Prasad, Barve,</b> and Gandhi,[1] the film was produced by <b>Sohum Shah, Aanand</b> L. 
          Rai, <b>Mukesh Shah and Amita</b> Shah. Starring <b>Sohum</b> Shah in the lead role as <b>Vinayak</b> Rao, it follows the story of his search for a hidden treasure in the 
          20th century India village of <b>Tumbbad,</b> Maharashtra.</p>
          <p><b>Barve</b> began writing the script based on a story a friend had told him about in 1993, by Marathi writer <b>Narayan Dharap.</b> He wrote the first draft in 1997, 
            when he was 18 years old. From 2009 to 2010, he created a 700-page storyboard for the film. It was optioned by seven production companies who backed out and 
            went on the floor (went into production) three times. It was first shot in 2012 but after editing, <b>Barve</b> and Shah were not satisfied. The film was then re-written 
            and re-shot with filming completed in May 2015. <b>Pankaj Kumar</b> served as the director of photography while <b>Sanyukta Kaza</b> was its editor. 
            <b>Jesper</b> Kyd composed the original score while <b>Ajayâ€“Atul</b> composed one song.</p>
